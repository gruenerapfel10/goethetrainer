## Tech Stack Optimizations for Speed

### Use These Libraries/Tools
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM (already set up) - fast migrations
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui (already installed) - no custom CSS needed
- **File Upload**: uploadthing or Vercel Blob - instant setup
- **AI**: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs - no ML model training
- **Auth**: NextAuth (existing) - just add roles
- **Forms**: react-hook-form + zod - validation included
- **State**: Zustand - simpler than Redux
- **Tables**: TanStack Table - feature complete
- **Calendar**: react-big-calendar - no custom build
- **PDF**: react-pdf - document preview ready

### Copy These Patterns
- Use existing chat UI patterns for essay assistant
- Adapt admin dashboard for student dashboard
- Reuse file upload modal from knowledge base
- Copy table components for application lists
- Leverage existing AI integration for new features

### AI Acceleration Tips
1. **Generate all schemas first** - Let AI write complete Drizzle schemas
2. **Scaffold all pages** - Create all route files upfront
3. **Bulk create API routes** - Generate all CRUD operations at once
4. **Component library** - Build reusable components once
5. **Sample data** - Generate realistic test data immediately
